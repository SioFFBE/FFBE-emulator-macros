Summon away your raid coins as fast as possible. It's crash safe (not during Item World yet) and will even reconnect on connection error. It will get stuck once you run out of coins. There is a very small chance of the macro getting stuck if you get fewer than 11 units from a summon. But this is so unlikely, it's hardly worth mentioning, as long as we multi summon for 100 pulls (which is the norm now).
