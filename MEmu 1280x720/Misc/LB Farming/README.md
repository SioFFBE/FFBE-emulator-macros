Start the macro after you entered Inferno Hollow - Fire Beast's Lair with your prepared unit(s), look at available guides for what that means and take NO companion.

All this macro does is click Auto and the buttons to restart the game in case of a crash. It will not start the mission nor finish it. Do not use this anywhere else.
