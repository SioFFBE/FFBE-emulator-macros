Farms *Gil Snapper's Cave - Golden Cavern* or *Cactuar Dunes - Paradise* using repeat with full crash recovery etc.

* **Not tested for crash safety with item world running**
* **In theory, it could enter a lower stage than intended** If it can actually happen, it's very rare, but you were warned.
* Unit 2+3 auto attack, rest uses repeat action

Make sure to have plenty of unit space :)
