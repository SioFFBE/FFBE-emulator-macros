Will enter the mailbox if it ever crashes to the FFBE home screen. It will then try and collect mail. It may or may not actually collect mail, if there is a mail item large enough to push the button down far enough (so a bundle or something with many different items). In all other cases it will just get stuck there and maybe refresh your mail once.

NOT a spam type, so it can get stuck/fuse incorrectly if you have long load/transition times or your emulator doesn't run smoothly or you get a connection loss.

It is meant to be sped up within MEmu. Some can run it safely at 2x some only at 0.5x (though that seems terribly slow). If you are unsure your configuration is up to it, do NOT leave it unattended! Best to test it for a while.

You start it at the "select unit to enhance screen" with the following filters:

Filter for enhancement selection:

Sort by level, ascending
2, 3 or 4 Star (depending on which you want to fuse)
Unit Lvl: Non-Max
Enhance


Filter for unit to fuse selection:

Sort by level, descending
2, 3 or 4 Star (depending on which you want to fuse)
Unit Lvl: Non-Max
Enhance
Craftable


It will always try to max the currently highest cactuar and start with the next after max lvl is reached. This is not the best efficiency* so if this bothers you act accordingly. Just in case: lock everything important to you.

If you run out of material to fuse (so 1 cactuar left) it will get stuck telling you, that you have selected no fuse material. If you run out of cactuar bases to fuse stuff into (so your last possible fuse brought the cactuar to max level) it will just get stuck on the selection screen.
