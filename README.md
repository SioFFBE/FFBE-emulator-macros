# Introduction

I offer a collection of Macros, mainly for TMR farming and Explorations, but also have a few odd ones for the following resolution settings in your emulator:

* **1280x720 Memu in forced portrait mode**
* **720x1280 Memu**
* *720x1280 Nox -as is*

**The specified resolution needs to be set in your emulator for the macros to work!**

# General Warnings & Infos

* Read the notes attached to the macros **before using them**.
* Use at your own Risk, here is a response by Gumi to u/jblazer21883 about macroing: [https://imgur.com/gallery/eXqyT](https://imgur.com/gallery/eXqyT) and here about general use of emulators: [https://brave-exvius.com/threads/psa-macro-usage-has-been-banned.38128/page-5#post-879619](https://brave-exvius.com/threads/psa-macro-usage-has-been-banned.38128/page-5#post-879619)
* If you let Explorations run overnight, make sure to have sufficient material spots (TMR will just get stuck)
* Ensure that any purchase requires a password (Amazon/Google)!
* Explorations will not refill. They get stuck.
* No reviving after death.
* Start the macros at the mission select screen.
* All achievements have to be cleared for the corresponding mission **Explorations won't work without this!**
* Use unequipped and weak units for TMR farming spots (50-150 atk should be fine) if you are using an older version than the 2.0, so that if they ever enter a stage after a crash, they get stuck.
* **I try my very best to make every macro as good as I can and as safe as I can, but please remind yourself, I do this in my spare time, for free, often late at night/early in the morning. I make errors like everybody else. I have never had any *bad* problems as of yet, but it could happen. The obvious upside of these macros is the large user base that has probably spent millions of energy by now, reducing the risk of a so far unnoticed flaw with every run and that I am fairly experienced at what not to ever do.**
* You are free to link here or edit these macros *for yourself*. Editing is dangerous though. There is no other way to say this. Moving a click by 1 pixel, can, when the worst case happens (*waves at Murphy*) have extreme consequences. So please do not post edited versions in the comments. If you see a reason to change something, I am always open for suggestions, so just send me a PM and I can run it through my verification process. If it checks out, I'll gladly update and credit you.

# FFBE Settings that work best/are required

* Language: English (different sized buttons/invisible hit boxes due to language *could* be a problem!)
* Tap to Move: On (required for explorations)
* Navigation Method: Flick (required for explorations)
* Dialogue Auto: Off (advised)
* Dialogue Skip: On (advised)
* Auto LB: On (Especially when farming Explorations or just straight up LB)
* **Arrange your home screen like** [**this**](http://imgur.com/a/D4GIu)
* Link to Facebook, or it might hit the login button when restarting
* [How to change the Launcher in Nox.](https://redd.it/83u1ye)
* [How to change the Launcher in Memu.](https://redd.it/6prfxs) (starts at step 9)
* [How to remove the Launcher in Memu completely after changing it.](https://redd.it/8ru1w4)
* Use [this spreadsheet (make a copy)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MdSGUUBuwzyPrmBSI3_C0p2OS15WOYnguB0zlbvj0XQ/copy) to see which unit attacks the fastest for your TMR Unit positioning. You can either select the units currently in your team and see who attacks the fastest or use the unit list and turn of sorting by name to see who attacks the fastest in general.

* [This post](https://redd.it/8i6b08) by u/HoLeeFoook goes into great detail about the whole attack speed thing. Really worth a read. Remember that even 1 second in difference means hours saved.
* u/AABBWW suggested that [Notifications can cause crashes](https://redd.it/7blzjg) and as we don't need them, I would suggest to turn them off, to be on the safe side.
* **Friends.** If you run out of friends, you will often get stuck (only a few versions can deal with this, this can't be changed!). Doesn't matter why, it's not possible to click depart without companion (e.g. the top most friend spot).

# Features

* recover from crash while in combat for *most macros*. If you crash out of combat, the macro will get stuck
* get stuck on emulator home screen after crash for *Explorations* (if you followed my [Home Screen Template](https://imgur.com/a/D4GIu))
* click away connection loss
* decline friend requests
* clear daily quests
* tested for FFBE GL 3.0.2 (watch for UI-Changes, these can create issues)

# How to install a macro (Memu -new way)

Download the .scp file of the macro you want to use. Use the import function in "Operation Record". Macro and settings will be imported. Please double check them to see if they fit your needs.

# How to install a macro (Memu -old way)

Open the one you want to use from down below and open your Memu folder. If you used the standard installation path this should be "C:\\Program Files\\Microvirt\\MEmu". Open the folder "Scripts". Open Memu. (Make the "Operation Record" button visible.) Record a small macro by pressing the record button, clicking anywhere within Memu and click stop. Rename the Macro to whatever you like. Go back to the Scripts folder we have opened, a new file should be there (show creation date can help identify macros if you have many of them). Open the Macro with an editor (I guess Notepad is fine, I would advise Notepad++ though). Copy and paste everything from the macro file into your file and save it. There is no need for a blank line in my macros.

# Macro settings (Memu -old way)

To have the macro repeat until manually stopped, set **Times** to **0**. "Unlimited Playback" just doesn't seem to work. As an alternative you can change this to a set amount of time to repeat, for example, just enough so you don't lose any energy over night and start with an almost full bar in the morning.

# How to install a macro (Nox)

Open the one you want to use from down below. Press Win+R and enter %appdata%, go up one to AppData, open Local, open Nox, open record. Open Nox and click the Macro button. Record a small macro by pressing the play button, clicking anywhere within Nox and click stop. Rename the Macro to whatever you like. Go back to the record folder we have opened, a new file should be there (show creation date can help identify macros if you have many of them). Open the Macro with an editor (I guess Notepad is fine, I would advise Notepad++ though). Copy and paste everything from the macro file into your file and save it. There is no need for a blank line in my macros.
